### Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
    The primary design decision I made was to closely align the project with the provided Figma design. However, certain aspects required clarification, such as the level of zoom for data points and the default number of points to be displayed. Another significant consideration was scalability. Given the project's scope, I opted to cater to a smaller traffic volume and store values on the front-end. This approach circumvented the need for a caching mechanism to save previous search results, which, while potentially improving search times, would have significantly increased the complexity of the project.

### How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
    The assignment took me a total of 6 hours to complete. The time was distributed as follows: 1 hour dedicated to planning, 3 hours to coding, and the remaining 2 hours were spent on debugging.


### If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
    If I could revisit the project's inception, I would advise myself to first gain a comprehensive understanding of the graph framework. This foundational knowledge would have streamlined the process significantly, as a considerable amount of time was spent on achieving the desired output from the graph.

### Did you learn anything new?
    Victory Graphing framework is neat. Its clean and intuitive design made it a pleasure to work.

### Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
     Yes I do feel like this assignment allowed me to showcase my end-to-end project capibilities.

### Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
    I think that this showcased my skillset appropriately.
